This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/rYyhwJAxMfES5jNQ9YsP) was to build an application to complete the following user stories.

1. I can see a list of photos in the masonry layout that I have added
2. I can add a new photo to the list - the new photo should be on top of the list
3. I can search for photos by label
4. When I hover a photo, I can see a label and a delete button
5. I can delete images
6. (optional): When I delete an image, I can enter my password
